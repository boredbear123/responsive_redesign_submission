                    <p id="explanation">I chose Calientes Mexican Grill because it is one of my favorite places to eat
                        out on Thayer street, and it is also a custom-made restaurant site.

                        <p class="issue-text">The home screen of the website has a video background with the
                            navigation bar and logo overlaid.
                            When the video is lighter it is hard to see the white text of the navigation bar, and
                            the
                            video’s height makes it so that it take sup the entire screen and doesn't make it clear
                            that you
                            can scroll down on the page</p>

                        <img class="issue-pic" src="order-menu-issue.png" />
                        <p class="issue-text">When you scroll down on the homepage, the order and menu are not the first
                            things to come up, so
                            in terms of efficiency it is not that efficient to get people to the menu or to order
                            online.
                            (It does have it in the navigation bar, but users especially first time users tend to want
                            to
                            scroll on the page to get their bearings</p>

                        <p class="issue-text">The homepage is also cluttered and does not use white space/ blank space
                            well.
                            They have some
                            awesome pictures and videos but they need to be leveraged the right way</p>

                        <img class="issue-pic" src="reviews_problems.png" />
                        <p class="issue-text">In the reviews section on the homepage there are two buttons to aid in the
                            horizontal scroll of
                            the featured reviews but the buttons are not obvious what they do, even upon clicking on
                            them.

            <p id="WAVE-text">When using the WebAim WAVE to evaluate the accessibility of the website, they actually
                did a relatively
                good job in terms of having alt-tags and structural elements, but there were 11 Contrast Errors, with
                “Very low Contrast”, most of them were related to the navigation bar and the background video, which I
                had pointed out above.
